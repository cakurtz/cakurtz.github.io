title: Week 10

## What did you do this past week?

This week I began preparing for my algo test and was studying for my matrices exam that was supposed to be on Thursday, but ended up getting rescheduled for this upcoming Thursday. I was also spending a good amount of time working on my term project for Contemporary Issues in CS. I have been practicing interview problems on my spare time and taking a break from my personal project. 

## What's in your way? 

In my way this week are my two exams. I have an algo exam on Wednesday and then a matrices exam on Thursday. I also have the project for this class due on Thursday, so I have a lot to juggle at the moment.

## What will you do next week?

Next week I will take my exams and continue to work on my term project. I am planning on studying as much as I can with dedicating enough time to working on the project. I am going to be very busy all week.

## Experience in class:

This week was a very short week. On Monday we had class as usual, and then had Pariveda talk to us about their company and software development. Class on Friday was cancelled so we could attend the 50th Anniversary of the CS Department.

## Tip or Pick of the Week:

This week my tip is to always plan out your week ahead. This allows you to estimate how much time each task will take you and allow you to set goals for completing all the tasks you need to complete. This helps with getting on a schedule.
